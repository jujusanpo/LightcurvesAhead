Variable stars exhibit changes in brightness over time, and their classification is essential for understanding stellar evolution, distance measurements, and astrophysical processes. Traditional classification models require a large number of observations before an object can be confidently categorized. However, in real-time astronomy, early classification is crucial for prioritizing objects for follow-up observations.
This project aims to answer the question: Can we classify variable stars early, using only the first few observations in their lightcurves? Specifically, we will explore how soon we can reliably classify periodic variable stars (RR Lyrae, Cepheids, and Miras) using machine learning models trained on lightcurve data from the OGLE variables dataset.
